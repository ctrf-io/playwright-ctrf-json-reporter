# Playwright JSON Test Results Report

> Save Playwright test results as a JSON file

A Playwright JSON test reporter to create test reports that follow the CTRF standard.

[Common Test Report Format](https://ctrf.io) ensures the generation of uniform JSON test reports, independent of programming languages or test framework in use.

## Features

- Generate JSON test reports that are [CTRF](https://ctrf.io) compliant
- Customizable output options, minimal or comprehensive reports
- Straightforward integration with Playwright
- Enhanced test insights with detailed test information, environment details, and more.

## What is CTRF?

CTRF is a universal JSON test report schema that addresses the lack of a standardized format for JSON test reports.

**Consistency Across Tools:** Different testing tools and frameworks often produce reports in varied formats. CTRF ensures a uniform structure, making it easier to understand and compare reports, regardless of the testing tool used.

**Language and Framework Agnostic:** It provides a universal reporting schema that works seamlessly with any programming language and testing framework.

**Facilitates Better Analysis:** With a standardized format, programatically analyzing test outcomes across multiple platforms becomes more straightforward.

```json
{
  "results": {
    "tool": {
      "name": "playwright"
    },
    "summary": {
      "tests": 1,
      "passed": 1,
      "failed": 0,
      "pending": 0,
      "skipped": 0,
      "other": 0,
      "start": 1706828654274,
      "stop": 1706828655782
    },
    "tests": [
      {
        "name": "ctrf should generate the same report with any tool",
        "status": "passed",
        "duration": 100
      }
    ],
    "environment": {
      "appName": "MyApp",
      "buildName": "MyBuild",
      "buildNumber": "1"
    }
  }
}
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev playwright-ctrf-json-reporter
```

Add the reporter to your playwright.config.ts file:

```javascript
reporter: [
  ['list'], // You can combine multiple reporters
  ['playwright-ctrf-json-reporter', {}]
],
```

Run your tests:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

You'll find a JSON file named `ctrf-report.json` in the `ctrf` directory.

## Reporter Options

The reporter supports several configuration options:

```javascript
reporter: [
    ['playwright-ctrf-json-reporter', {
        outputFile: 'custom-name.json', // Optional: Output file name. Defaults to 'ctrf-report.json'.
        outputDir: 'custom-directory',  // Optional: Output directory path. Defaults to '.' (project root).
        minimal: true,                  // Optional: Generate a minimal report. Defaults to 'false'. Overrides screenshot and testType when set to true
        screenshot: false,              // Optional: Include screenshots in the report. Defaults to 'false'.
        testType: 'e2e',                // Optional: Specify the test type (e.g., 'api', 'e2e'). Defaults to 'e2e'.
        appName: 'MyApp',               // Optional: Specify the name of the application under test.
        appVersion: '1.0.0',            // Optional: Specify the version of the application under test.
        osPlatform: 'linux',            // Optional: Specify the OS platform.
        osRelease: '18.04',             // Optional: Specify the OS release version.
        osVersion: '5.4.0',             // Optional: Specify the OS version.
        buildName: 'MyApp Build',       // Optional: Specify the build name.
        buildNumber: '100',             // Optional: Specify the build number.
    }]
  ],
```

A comprehensive report is generated by default, with the exception of screenshots, which you must explicitly set to true.

## Test Object Properties

The test object in the report includes the following [CTRF properties](https://ctrf.io/docs/schema/test):

| Name         | Type             | Required | Details                                                                             |

## Advanced usage

Some features require additional setup or usage considerations.

### Screenshots

You can include base-64 screenshots in your test report, you'll need to capture and attach screenshots in your Playwright tests:

```javascript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('basic test', async ({ page }, testInfo) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev')
  const screenshot = await page.screenshot({ quality: 50, type: 'jpeg' })
  await testInfo.attach('screenshot', {
    body: screenshot,
    contentType: 'image/jpeg',
  })
})
```

#### Supported Formats

Both JPEG and PNG formats are supported, only the last screenshot attached from each test will be included in the report.

#### Size Considerations

Base64-encoded image data can greatly increase the size of your report, it's recommended to use screenshots with a lower quality setting (less than 50%) to reduce file size, particularly if you are generating JPEG images.

### Browser

You can include browser information in your test report. You will need to extend Playwright's test object to capture and attach browser metadata for each test:

```javascript
// tests/helpers.ts
import { test as _test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
import os from 'os';

export const test = _test.extend<{ _autoAttachMetadata: void }>({
    _autoAttachMetadata: [async ({ browser, browserName }, use, testInfo) => {
        // BEFORE: Generate an attachment for the test with the required info
        await testInfo.attach('metadata.json', {
            body: JSON.stringify({
                name: browserName,
                version: browser.version(),
            })
        })

        // ---------------------------------------------------------
        await use(/** our test doesn't need this fixture direcly */);
        // ---------------------------------------------------------

        // AFTER: There's nothing to cleanup in this fixutre
    }, { auto: true }],
})

export { expect };
```

Replace the standard Playwright test import with the custom test fixture in your test files:

```javascript
// tests/my-test.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './helpers' // Adjust the path as necessary

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
  // ... your test logic ...
})
```

The browser metadata file must be called metadata.json and contain properties name and version in the body.
